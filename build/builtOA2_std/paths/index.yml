## This additional_path block gets filled with any extra from the readonly and the normal api index

## place any readonly specific paths here


## All route registered in a single index file.
## Should this file be getting very long, think about breaking your API up into smaller service aka microservice architecture.
## In this simple example we are using 1 paths file for 2 apis, this base tpl is use by the full weather api and also the readonly api.
## The index.readonly.yml sets a var write to be false which results in the output not printing the post/put routes.. aka the write routes.
## This is a very handy feature to ensure as little human error as possible when maintaining public/private apis to the same data set.

# General routes to search and create items
/weather/:
  get:
    $ref: ./v1/weather/get.yml

  post:
    $ref: ./v1/weather/post.yml


# Item specific routes, note the prefix /{id}/{id}
/weather/id/{id}:
  get:
    $ref: ./v1/weather/id/get.yml

  put:
    $ref: ./v1/weather/id/put.yml


# As the above {id} is nested inside /{id}, we can now introduce another weather uri segment
/weather/latest:
  get:
    $ref: ./v1/weather/latest/get.yml
